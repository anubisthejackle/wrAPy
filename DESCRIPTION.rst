wrAPy
=====

wrAPy is the Python port of the PHP project wrAPI, which takes the ever changing,
ever confusing list of REST APIs that we developers use, and brings them together
under a standard, easy to remember, API.

Instead of trying to remember the quirks for each different API, wrAPy takes them
figures out the quirks, and puts it all together in such a way that you can simply
call the HTTP methods, like REST intended. GET/POST/PUT/DELETE. Those are the only
commands you should have to remember.
